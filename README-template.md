## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt to use flexbox to center the card and the contents inside it.

### Continued development

On my next project I want to focus on using grid layout to position elements.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me figure out how to use flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
